# Flutter

**Flutter** is the Google's cross platform mobile UI framework. It is no secret that Google is working on a third operating system 
that might someday replace whole Android and Chrome. Its called **Fuchsia**. It has been hearing out loudly that the new OS would solve the problem of Android fragmentation but still allowing google to run it on different types of devices including smartphones, tablets and computers.

Along with the new OS , Google is also working on new coding engine that will allow developers to deploy apps to all platforms 
including IOS. The main advantage of flutter is that the Companies don't have to invest in two development teams for Android and IOS.With Flutter, the companies can code their app at the same time and then deploy then on Android and IOS simultaneously.

As the stable version of the flutter has been introduced, i would strongly recommend all Android developers to give a try.
I will be writing up a series of articles on flutter in the coming weeks. In this tutorial i am going to explain how we can setup flutter in mac.
